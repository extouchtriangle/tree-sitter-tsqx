# tree-sitter-tsqx

This is a tree-sitter parser for
[cjquines/tsqx](https://github.com/cjquines/tsqx).
`tsqx` is a wrapper around the Asymptote
vector graphics language,
`tsqx` was developed with olympiad geometry as a focus,
so the syntax in the parser reflects that.

> [!WARNING]
> Even though the syntax is close to complete in terms
> of implementation, this is still in the alpha stage.
> Expect breaking changes to be pushed at any moment.
